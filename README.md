# Value-Returning-Functions

Problem: You will have to round numbers very often so you decided to create your own function round_off() that will receive the number to be rounded and the number of decimal digits that the number should be rounded to and will return the value rounded to the specified number of decimal digits.
You need to create a program to test the function. It will ask the user to enter the double precision real number to be rounded and a whole number indicating the number of decimal digits. It will then display the original number with ten digits and the rounded value (also a double precision real number) with the number of digits specified by the user plus 2 more.

1) First you will implement the algorithm shown below in which the rounding will be done in main()
2) Once you have this working you will need to modify your solution so you: Declare the prototype of the function above main()
Call the function in main() to do the rounding
Define the function below main()

To solve this problem your program must perform the following tasks:
Declare variable value, valuero that hold double precision real numbers Declare variable decdig that holds whole numbers
Prompt the user to "Enter the real number: "
Read from keyboard the value entered by the user and assign it to value Prompt the user to "Enter number of digits: "
Read from keyboard the value entered by the user and assign it to decdig
Round the real number to the number of decimal digits specified and assign the result to valuero Format the output to display the numbers in fixed format with ten decimal digits
Display on the screen, using 23 columns, the message
"The original number is ", value
Format the output to display the numbers in fixed format with the number of decimal digits specified plus 2
Display on the screen, using 23 columns, the message
"The rounded number is ", valuero

Test:
Enter the real number: 
Enter number of digits:
The original number is 
The rounded number is
